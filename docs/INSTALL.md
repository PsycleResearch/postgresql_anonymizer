INSTALL
===============================================================================

The installation process is composed of 4 basic steps:

* Step 1: **Deploy** the extension into the host server
* Step 2: **Load** the extension in the PostgreSQL instance
* Step 3: **Create** the extension inside the database
* Step 4: **Initialize** the extension internal data

There are multiple ways to install the extension :

* [Install on RedHat / CentOS]
* [Install with PGXN]
* [Install from source]
* [Install in the cloud]
* [Install with docker]
* [Install as a block box]
* [Install on MacOS]

In the examples below, we load the extension (step2) using a parameter called
`session_preload_librairies` but there are other ways to load it.
See [Load the extension] for more details.

If you're having any problem, check the [Troubleshooting] section.

[Install on RedHat / CentOS]: #install-on-redhat-centos
[Install with PGXN]: #install-with-pgxn
[Install from source]: #install-from-source
[Install in the cloud]: #install-in-the-cloud
[Install with docker]: #install-with-docker
[Install as a block box]: #install-as-a-black-box
[Install on MacOS]: #install-on-macos
[Load the extension]: #load-the-extension
[Troubleshooting]: #troubleshooting

Install on RedHat / CentOS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> This is the recommended way to install the extension


_Step 0:_ Add the [PostgreSQL Official RPM Repo] to your system. It shouldb be
something like:

```console
sudo yum install https://.../pgdg-redhat-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
```

[PostgreSQL Official RPM Repo]: https://yum.postgresql.org/


_Step 1:_ Deploy

```console
sudo yum install postgresql_anonymizer12
```

(Replace `12` with the major version of your PostgreSQL instance.)

_Step 2:_  Load the extension.

```sql
ALTER DATABASE foo SET session_preload_libraries = 'anon';
```

(If you already loading extensions that way, just add `anon` the current list)

_Step 3:_  Create the extension and load the anonymization data

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION anon CASCADE;
```

_Step 4:_  Initialize the extension

```sql
SELECT anon.init();
```

All new connections to the database can now use the extension.


Install With [PGXN](https://pgxn.org/) :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


_Step 1:_  Deploy the extension into the host server with:

```console
sudo apt install pgxnclient postgresql-server-dev-12
sudo pgxn install postgresql_anonymizer
```

(Replace `12` with the major version of your PostgreSQL instance.)

_Step 2:_  Load the extension.

```sql
ALTER DATABASE foo SET session_preload_libraries = 'anon';
```

(If you already loading extensions that way, just add `anon` the current list)

_Step 3:_  Create the extension

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION anon CASCADE;
```

_Step 4:_  Initialize the extension

```sql
SELECT anon.init();
```

All new connections to the database can now use the extension.


**Additional notes:**

* PGXN can also be installed with `pip install pgxn`
* If you have several versions of PostgreSQL installed on your system,
  you may have to point to the right version with the `--pg_config`
  parameter. See [Issue #93] for more details.
* Check out the [pgxn install documentation] for more information.

[pgxn install documentation]: https://github.com/pgxn/pgxnclient/blob/master/docs/usage.rst#pgxn-install
[Issue #93]: https://gitlab.com/dalibo/postgresql_anonymizer/issues/93


Install From source
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Step 0:_ First you need to install the postgresql development libraries.
On most distributions, this is available through a package called
`postgresql-devel` or `postgresql-server-dev`.

_Step 1:_  Build the project like any other PostgreSQL extension:

```console
make extension
sudo make install
```

_Step 2:_  Load the extension.

```sql
ALTER DATABASE foo SET session_preload_libraries = 'anon';
```

(If you already loading extensions that way, just add `anon` the current list)

_Step 3:_  Create the extension

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION anon CASCADE;
```

_Step 4:_  Initialize the extension

```sql
SELECT anon.init();
```

All new connections to the database can now use the extension.


Install in the cloud
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> **DISCLAIMER** if privacy and anonymity are a concern to you, hosting your
> data on someone else's computer is probably not a clever idea....

Generally Database As A Service operators ( such as Amazon RDS ) do not allow
their clients to load any extension. Instead they support only a limited subset
of extensions, such as PostGIS or pgcrypto. You can ask them if they plan to
support this one in the near future, but you shouldn't bet your life on it ðŸ˜ƒ

However this tool is set of `plpgsql` functions, which means should you be able
to install it directly without declaring an extension.

Here's a few steps to try it out:

```console
git clone https://gitlab.com/dalibo/postgresql_anonymizer.git
make anon_standalone.sql
psql ..... -f anon_standalone.sql
```

In this situation, you will have to declare the masking rules with `COMMENT`
instead of security labels. See [Declaring Rules with COMMENTs] for more details.

[Declaring Rules with COMMENTs]: declare_masking_rules.md#declaring-rules-with-comments

### Special Notes about Dynamic Masking and DBaaS providers

Here's a few remarks on how to make the [Dynamic Masking] work on a cloud
PostgreSQL service :


First, when you activate the masking engine, you need also to disable `autoload`
(because the data was already loaded by the `anon_standalone.sql` script):

```sql
SELECT anon.start_dynamic_masking( autoload := FALSE );
```

Second, the [Dynamic Masking] engine will put [Event Triggers] on the tables.
In order to do that, you must be allowed to create event triggers, which means
either being a superuser or having a role with similar privileges.

Creating [Event Triggers] may or may be not be supported by your cloud
operator. For instance, [Amazon RDS supports event triggers] since version 9.4
while [Alibaba Cloud does not allow them]. You should refer to your provider's
documentation or its customer service to check if this feature is available.


[Dynamic Masking]: dynamic_masking.md
[Event Triggers]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/event-triggers.html
[Amazon RDS supports event triggers]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_PostgreSQL.html#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.FeatureSupport.EventTriggers
[Alibaba Cloud does not allow them]: https://gitlab.com/dalibo/postgresql_anonymizer/-/issues/126



Install with Docker
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you can't (or don't want to) install the PostgreSQL Anonymizer extension
directly inside your instance, then you can use the docker image :

```console
docker pull registry.gitlab.com/dalibo/postgresql_anonymizer:stable
```

The image is available with 2 two tags:

* `latest` (default) contains the current developments
* `stable` is the based on the previous release

You can run the docker image like the regular [postgres docker image].

[postgres docker image]: https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres

For example:

Launch start a postgres docker container

```console
docker run -d --name anon -p 6543:5432 registry.gitlab.com/dalibo/postgresql_anonymizer
```

Connect :

```console
psql -h localhost -p6543 -U postgres
```

The extension is already created and initialized, you can use it directly:

```sql
# SELECT anon.partial_email('daamien@gmail.com');
     partial_email
-----------------------
 da******@gm******.com
(1 row)
```

Install as a "Black Box"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


You can also treat the docker image as an "anonymizing black box" by using a
specific entrypoint script called `/anon.sh`. You pass the original data
and the masking rules to the `/anon.sh` script and it will return a anonymized
dump.

Here's an example in 4 steps:

_Step 1:_  Dump your original data (for instance `dump.sql`)

```console
pg_dump [...] my_db > dump.sql
```

If you want to maintain the owners and grants, you need export them with
`pg_dumpall --roles-only` like this:

```console
(pg_dumpall [...] --roles-only && pg_dump [...] my_db ) > dump.sql
```


_Step 2:_  Write your masking rules in a separate file (for instance `rules.sql`)

```sql
SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', 'public', false);

CREATE EXTENSION anon CASCADE;
SELECT anon.init();

SECURITY LABEL FOR anon ON COLUMN people.lastname
IS 'MASKED WITH FUNCTION anon.fake_last_name()';

-- etc.
```

_Step 3:_  Pass the dump and the rules through the docker image and receive an
anonymized dump !

```console
IMG=registry.gitlab.com/dalibo/postgresql_anonymizer
ANON="docker run --rm -i $IMG /anon.sh"
cat dump.sql rules.sql | $ANON > anon_dump.sql
```

(this last step is written on 3 lines for clarity)

_NB:_ You can also gather _step 1_ and _step 3_ in a single command:

```console
(pg_dumpall --roles-only && pg_dump my_db) | cat - rules.sql | $ANON > anon_dump.sql
```


Install on MacOS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although the extension is not officially supported on MacOS systems, it should
be possible to build the extension with the following lines:

```console
export C_INCLUDE_PATH="$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)/usr/include"
make extension
make install
```


Load the extension
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's some additional notes about how you can load the extension:

### 1- Load only for one database

You can load the extension exclusively into a specific database like this:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE mydatabase SET session_preload_libraries='anon'
```

Then quit your current session and open a new one.

It has several benefits:

* First, it will be dumped by `pg_dump` with the`-C` option, so the database
  dump will be self efficient.

* Second, it is propagated to a standby instance by streaming replication.
  Which means you can use the anonymization functions on a read-only clone
  of the database (provided the extension is installed on the standby instance)

### 2- Load for the instance

You can load the extension with the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter.

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries = 'anon'"
```

Then restart the PostgreSQL instance.


### 3- Load on the fly

For a one-time usage, You can the [LOAD] command

```sql
LOAD '/usr/lib/postgresql/12/lib/anon.so';
```

You can read the [Shared Library Preloading] section of the PostgreSQL documentation
for more details.

[LOAD]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-load.html
[Shared Library Preloading]:https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-CLIENT-PRELOAD

Troubleshooting
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are having difficulties, you may have missed a step during the
installation processus. Here's a quick checklist to help you:

### Check that the extension is present

First, let's see if the extension was correctly deployed:

```console
ls $(pg_config --sharedir)/extension/anon
ls $(pg_config --pkglibdir)/anon.so
```

If you get an error, the extension is probably not present on host server.
Go back to step 1.

### Check that the extension is loaded

Now connect to your database and look at the configuration with:

```sql
SHOW local_preload_libraries;
SHOW session_preload_libraries;
SHOW shared_preload_libraries;
```

If you don't see `anon` in any of these paramaters, go back to step 2.

### Check that the extension is created

Again connect to your database and type:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname= 'anon';
```

If the result is empty, the extension is not declared in your database.
Go back to step 3.

### Check that the extension is initialized

Finally, look at the state of the extension:

```sql
SELECT anon.is_initialized();
```

If the result is not `t`, the extension data is not present.
Go back to step 4.
